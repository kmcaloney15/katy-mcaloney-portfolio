# Katy-McAloney-Portfolio

Hi! I am Katy McAloney.

With a background in marketing and a love for solving puzzles, I've found a huge passion for web design and debugging. I am a self-motivated, collaborative critical thinker with strong organizational and communication skills. I'm energized by working with cross functional teams and am looking forward to joining a creative team to solve technical challenges and debug your code.
